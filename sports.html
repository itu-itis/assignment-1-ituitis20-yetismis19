                Our school is a NAVAL ACADEMY, and it located in Heybeliada so we have every opportunity 
                to perfrom sea sports. And we are very good at it. For instance we have sailing team, cano team and Row
                team.In sea sports we encourage the students to participate in  various kind
                of sea races. And as a side in order to perform sailing,row, cano you do not
                need to be in the team.

                    individually in single boats.However if you are team guy
                    you can use not single, multi person boats and race with
